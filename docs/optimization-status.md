# git-span Optimization Status

Date: 2026-04-29

## Scope

This round focused on `packages/git-span`, especially `git span stale` on large repositories. The target repository for external benchmarks was `vercel/next.js`, using `scripts/bench-span.sh` from the workspace root.

No persistent cache was added. The new reuse points are per-command state only and are dropped when the CLI invocation exits.

## Profiling Tooling

- `scripts/bench-span.sh`: benchmark harness that clones or updates a bare Next.js cache, creates scratch worktrees, seeds spans, and records operation latency to Markdown and CSV.
- `GIT_SPAN_PERF=1` and `git span --perf`: opt-in internal timing logs emitted to stderr as `git-span perf: <operation> <ms> ms`.
- Kept benchmark fixtures with `scripts/bench-span.sh --keep` for repeatable local profiling against the same seeded repo.
- Direct dirty-fixture profiling with commands like:

```sh
GIT_SPAN_PERF=1 git -C /tmp/git-span-bench-h0tfrp/v9.0.0 span stale --no-exit-code
```

## Optimizations Applied

- Added opt-in performance logging behind `--perf` and `GIT_SPAN_PERF=1`.
- Reused one `EngineState` across workspace-wide `stale` resolution instead of recreating layer state per span.
- Added per-command commit reachability reuse and a `HEAD == anchor` reachability fast path.
- Shared grouped history walks in `ResolveSession` by `(anchor_sha, copy_detection)`.
- Added a clean tracked-layer status probe so clean index/worktree paths skip full structured diff initialization.
- Added a dirty-path targeted worktree diff path. `git status --porcelain=v1 -z -uno` provides exact tracked worktree path hints for simple dirty states; rename, copy, malformed, or unmerged cases fail closed to existing full scans.
- Added fresh-HEAD fast paths for line-range and whole-file anchors when content layers match `HEAD`.
- Removed repeated repository opens from read paths by using the already-open `gix::Repository` for anchor and span reads.
- Added per-command `HEAD:path` blob lookup reuse for repeated anchor paths.
- Added a scale benchmark harness, `scripts/bench-span-scale.sh`, for synthetic 100/1,000/10,000 span sweeps with 2/3/4/5 primary anchors, optional 10/20/120 edge anchors, line/whole/mixed anchor distributions, loose-ref/packed-ref/maintenance variants, and process-per-query wiki `ls <path>#L<start>-L<end> --porcelain` timing.
- Avoided reading span config blobs in `git span list`, which only needs the span why text and anchor ids.
- Replaced repeated linear staged/committed name checks in `git span list` with command-local `HashSet` membership.
- Removed a redundant post-render span commit info lookup from default `git span show <name>`.
- Added a span-ref enumeration path that carries each span ref's target OID into bulk reads. `list`, workspace-wide `stale`, and `pre-commit` no longer parse the same span revision once during listing and again during the span read.
- Made `git span list --porcelain` skip committed span why text and staged-state reads unless `--search` or human rendering needs them.
- Reworked `git span pre-commit` to resolve committed spans through one shared resolver state, matching the workspace-wide `stale` reuse pattern while preserving staging-only span reporting.

Dirty-worktree profiling on a kept v9 fixture improved from about 502 ms before targeted layer initialization to about 14 ms after the latest read-path changes, with byte-identical output.

Continued scale loop synthetic mixed-anchor results:

| spans | anchors/span | add | commit | show | list --porcelain | filtered list hit | filtered list miss | stale | pre-commit | wiki hit workload | wiki miss workload |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|

The synthetic scale harness intentionally uses a process-per-query wiki workload because the downstream wiki CLI currently shells out once per fragment link. The 1,000-span fixture used mixed anchors: one whole-file wiki anchor plus one code line-range anchor per span.

Direct `GIT_SPAN_PERF=1` on the kept 1,000-span fixture:

| operation | total | notable spans |
|---|---:|---|
| `list --porcelain` | 91.221 ms | list span refs 7.849 ms; read committed span/anchor records 81.376 ms; sort/page/render 1.817 ms |
| `list src/module_001.rs#L15-L19 --porcelain` | 87.477 ms | list span refs 6.074 ms; read committed span/anchor records 81.101 ms; path filter 0.069 ms |
| `stale --no-exit-code` | 2,576.988 ms | list spans 6.287 ms; init layers 8.685 ms; resolve all spans 2,570.378 ms; render human 6.310 ms |

Post-pass direct `GIT_SPAN_PERF=1` on a fresh 1,000-span, 2-anchor mixed fixture:

| operation | total | notable spans |
|---|---:|---|
| `list --porcelain` | 91.656 ms | list span refs 19.135 ms; read committed span/anchor records 70.977 ms; sort/page/render 1.361 ms |
| `list src/module_001.rs#L15-L19 --porcelain` | 89.138 ms | list span refs 19.131 ms; read committed span/anchor records 69.583 ms; path filter 0.220 ms |
| `stale --no-exit-code` | 1,718.633 ms | resolve all spans 1,718.439 ms; resolve span loop 1,695.391 ms; render human 0.001 ms |
| `pre-commit --no-exit-code` | 2,643.159 ms | shared resolve span loop 2,576.382 ms; pre-commit resolve wrapper 2,631.430 ms |

Post-pass 100-span, 2-anchor mixed harness sample:

| spans | anchors/span | list --porcelain | filtered list hit | filtered list miss | stale | pre-commit | wiki hit workload | wiki miss workload |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 100 | 2 | 0.0210s | 0.0737s | 0.0264s | 0.4145s | 0.4399s | 3 queries / 0.1367s | 3 queries / 0.1470s |

Top bottlenecks found:

- Filtered `list` is still O(all committed span/anchor records). The path/range filter is cheap once records are materialized; the remaining bottleneck is the current ref/object layout and lack of an authoritative path-oriented index.
- Workspace-wide `stale` at 1,000 spans is dominated by repeated anchor resolution, not span ref enumeration or rendering.
- `pre-commit` is substantially slower than plain `stale` on the synthetic fixture and needs a separate hook-path profile before changing behavior.
- `show <name>` remains effectively O(anchors in that span) at this scale.
- Span-ref re-resolution was a measurable bulk-read cost. Carrying span ref OIDs from enumeration into `ls`, `stale`, and `pre-commit` improved the 1,000-span `stale` direct run from the prior documented 2.577 s to 1.719 s on the new fixture, and reduced `pre-commit` from the prior 7.779 s harness result to 2.643 s direct perf on the new fixture.

Accepted experiments:

- Keep the current storage model for this pass and continue evolutionary read-path fixes.
- Add a synthetic benchmark harness before attempting a schema change.
- Use command-local data structures only; no persistent cache or sidecar cache state was added.
- Reuse span ref target OIDs in bulk operations. This is command-local state derived from authoritative Git refs and avoids repeated revision parsing.
- Share one resolver state across `pre-commit` committed span resolution.

Rejected or deferred experiments:

- Durable path/range index: likely needed for 10,000-span wiki workloads, but deferred until the new harness completes 10,000-span, packed-ref, and maintenance variants. If added, it should be authoritative Git-backed span metadata, not a derived cache.
- Reftable-specific path: deferred because local fixture coverage and Git support detection still need to be added to the harness.
- Automatic Git maintenance during normal CLI operations: deferred to avoid surprising repository mutation. The harness can measure `--pack-refs` and `--maintenance` variants explicitly.
- Command-local anchor-ref OID snapshot: rejected for now. On the 1,000-span fixture it added a 30-60 ms namespace scan/peel cost to `list` and regressed `stale` to about 4.7 s because the resolver already benefits from targeted anchor ref reads and object reuse.

## 10,000-Span Scale Findings and Schema Change Decision

A full 10,000-span benchmarking matrix was prepared using `scripts/bench-span-scale.sh`. Profiling confirmed that `list <path> --porcelain` without an index remains effectively `O(all committed span/anchor records)`, leading to unacceptable latency for downstream tools like the wiki renderer which requires a per-query process invocation.

| design | expected filtered `list` complexity | write cost | storage cost | failure mode | migration needed now? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| current refs | O(all span/anchor records) | current | high ref count | ref iteration/object reads | no |
| span-embedded anchors | O(spans) or better with index | lower refs | more commit-tree data | commit tree parse errors | no, greenfield only |
| authoritative path/range index | O(path bucket + matching spans) | extra tree writes | bounded tree blobs | stale index impossible if authoritative | no, greenfield only |
| reftable-aware refs | still O(log/scan refs), faster constants | current | backend-dependent | unavailable backend | no |

**Decision:** We are proceeding with **span-embedded anchors** (`anchors.v2` embedded layout).
- Removing anchor refs entirely drops the repository ref count from 30,000 down to 10,000 (at 10,000 spans with 2 anchors).
- It fundamentally shifts filtered `list` to `O(spans)` object reads by side-stepping the need to materialize ~20,000 distinct anchor `blob` and `ref` objects.
- It preserves `fail-closed` behavior, natively utilizes existing tree atomicity, and requires no daemon state or cross-span index maintenance contention.

Implementation of the greenfield `anchors.v2` layout slice is complete:
- `git span list` and `git span stale` prioritize the `anchors.v2` blob over individual legacy ref resolution.
- 10,000-span benchmark artifacts have been recorded.

## Breakthrough v3: Authoritative Path Index

The next measured bottleneck after `anchors.v2` was filtered `list`. On a 10,000-span, 2-anchor mixed fixture, direct perf showed the path/range predicate itself was cheap, but command execution still materialized every committed span before filtering:

| operation | total | notable spans |
|---|---:|---|
| `list --porcelain` | 397.749 ms | list span refs 131.637 ms; read committed span records 249.563 ms |
| `list src/module_001.rs#L15-L19 --porcelain` | 380.219 ms | list span refs 168.766 ms; read committed span records 209.659 ms; path filter 0.388 ms |

Harness baseline on the same scale:

| op | result |
|---|---:|
| `list_filtered_hit` | 0.3439 s |
| `list_filtered_miss` | 0.3362 s |
| `wiki_hit_queries` | 20 queries / 7.2783 s |
| `wiki_miss_queries` | 20 queries / 7.1594 s |

Decision matrix update:

| design | expected filtered `list` complexity | write cost | storage cost | failure mode | migration needed now? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| current `anchors.v2` only | O(spans) | current | 10,000 span refs plus span commits | ref iteration and per-span object reads dominate | no |
| packed refs / reftable only | still O(spans), lower constants possible | current | backend-dependent | unavailable backend or still object-read bound | no |
| CLI batching | O(queries * matching work) process cost amortized | new public surface | none | downstream adoption required | yes, if exposed |
| authoritative path-index refs | O(path bucket + matching spans) | update affected path buckets transactionally with span ref | one ref/blob per indexed path | transaction conflict fails closed | no, greenfield only |

**Decision:** Implement **authoritative path-index refs** for filtered porcelain `list`.
- Each indexed path has a deterministic ref under `refs/spans-index/v1/path/<sha256-shard>/<sha256>`.
- The ref points at a blob with sorted `(span, start, end)` rows for that path. Whole-file anchors are represented as `0	0`.
- `commit`, `delete`, `move`, and `revert` update affected path-index refs in the same reference transaction as the span ref.
- `git span list <path>[#Lx-Ly] --porcelain` uses the path index to expand only matching committed span names, then reads those spans to preserve the existing porcelain contract of rendering every anchor in each matching span.
- Human `list`, `--search`, and unfiltered porcelain keep the existing full listing path.

Measured on the kept 10,000-span fixture after backfilling index refs to simulate a greenfield indexed repository:

| operation | total | notable spans |
|---|---:|---|
| `list src/module_001.rs#L15-L19 --porcelain` | 2.816 ms | path-index lookup 1.382 ms; candidate expansion 1.328 ms |
| missing filtered `list` | 1.422 ms | path-index lookup 0.234 ms; pending scan 1.128 ms |
| 20 wiki hit queries | 0.2230 s | process-per-query workload |
| 20 wiki miss queries | 0.1881 s | process-per-query workload |

This changes the hot filtered `list` path from scanning 10,000 span commits to reading one path bucket plus matching span commits. In this synthetic fixture, the direct in-process hit improved from ~380 ms to ~2.8 ms, and the wiki-style 20-query process workload improved from ~7.3 s to ~0.22 s.
