//! `ResolveSession` — engine-wide shared computation for one `stale` run.
//!
//! Groups anchors by `(repo, anchor_sha)` and walks `anchor..HEAD` exactly
//! once per group. The per-commit name-status entries (with rewrite
//! tracking enabled) are produced once per commit and shared across:
//!
//! - the per-anchor line-range HEAD walker (`resolve_at_head_shared`),
//! - the whole-file rename trail (`follow_path_to_head_shared`).
//!
//! The session is constructed once at the top of the `stale` CLI path and
//! threaded through `resolve_anchor_inner`. There is no caching across
//! runs — the session lives only for the duration of one engine call and
//! is dropped when it returns.
//!
//! ## Candidate-path filtering (Pass 1 + Pass 2)
//!
//! The expensive per-commit work is `name_status` with rewrite tracking
//! enabled. Most commits in `anchor..HEAD` don't touch any path the
//! mesh's anchors care about, so we skip the rewrite-aware tree-diff for
//! those commits. Skipped commits still appear in `commits` with
//! `entries: vec![]`, which `walker::advance_with_entries` treats as a
//! no-op (no path matches → `Change::Unchanged`). The `parent` slot
//! still threads to the previous commit in the walk so that, if a later
//! commit *is* interesting, the diff baseline is correct.
//!
//! Candidate paths are seeded by the caller via `prepare_group` with the
//! union of all anchor paths in the mesh. As the rewrite-aware pass on
//! interesting commits discovers `Renamed{from, to}` / `Copied{from,
//! to}` entries where `from` is already tracked, `to` is added to the
//! candidate set so subsequent commits that touch the new name are
//! correctly classified as interesting. Copy detection (anything other
//! than `CopyDetection::Off`) widens the trigger: any commit with at
//! least one added path is treated as interesting because a same-commit
//! copy can introduce a new tracked path with no parent-side change.
//!
//! "Sharing a single computation across consumers, not storing past
//! results."
