//! `ResolveSession` — engine-wide shared state for one `stale` run.
//!
//! The reverse-indexed HEAD walk (built by [`ResolveSession::build_reverse_walk`])
//! runs once and produces per-anchor commit deltas. Each anchor's classifier
//! consumes its slice of the walk output instead of running its own per-anchor
//! walk. The session is constructed once at the top of the `stale` CLI path and
//! threaded through `resolve_anchor_inner`. There is no caching across runs —
//! the session lives only for the duration of one engine call and is dropped
//! when it returns.
