//! `ResolveSession` — engine-wide shared computation for one `stale` run.
//!
//! Groups anchors by `(repo, anchor_sha)` and walks `anchor..HEAD` exactly
//! once per group. The per-commit name-status entries (with rewrite
//! tracking enabled) are produced once per commit and shared across:
//!
//! - the per-anchor line-range HEAD walker (`resolve_at_head_shared`),
//! - the whole-file rename trail (`follow_path_to_head_shared`).
//!
//! The session is constructed once at the top of the `stale` CLI path and
//! threaded through `resolve_anchor_inner`. There is no caching across
//! runs — the session lives only for the duration of one engine call and
//! is dropped when it returns.
//!
//! ## Candidate-path filtering (Pass 1 + Pass 2)
//!
//! The expensive per-commit work is `name_status` with rewrite tracking
//! enabled. Most commits in `anchor..HEAD` don't touch any path the
//! mesh's anchors care about, so we skip the rewrite-aware tree-diff for
//! those commits. Skipped commits still appear in `commits` with
//! `entries: vec![]`, which `walker::advance_with_entries` treats as a
//! no-op (no path matches → `Change::Unchanged`). The `parent` slot
//! still threads to the previous commit in the walk so that, if a later
//! commit *is* interesting, the diff baseline is correct.
//!
//! Candidate paths are seeded by the caller via `prepare_group` with the
//! union of all anchor paths in the mesh. As the rewrite-aware pass on
//! interesting commits discovers `Renamed{from, to}` / `Copied{from,
//! to}` entries where `from` is already tracked, `to` is added to the
//! candidate set so subsequent commits that touch the new name are
//! correctly classified as interesting. Copy detection (anything other
//! than `CopyDetection::Off`) widens the trigger: any commit with at
//! least one added path is treated as interesting because a same-commit
//! copy can introduce a new tracked path with no parent-side change.
//!
//! "Sharing a single computation across consumers, not storing past
//! results."

/// Pass 1: discover every historical name any seed path has had in
/// `anchor_sha..HEAD` and the set of commits whose `--name-status` rows
/// touch any of those names.
///
/// Implementation note on pathspec: git applies `-- <pathspec>` *before*
/// rename detection, so `git log -M -- foo.rs` clips the `R foo.rs
/// bar.rs` row down to `D foo.rs` (the destination side falls outside
/// the pathspec). Running `-M` over the full range (no pathspec) is
/// correct but pays the rename-detection cost on every commit — too
/// expensive on long histories.
///
/// The hybrid used here keeps both halves cheap:
///
/// 1. **Cheap pass (pathspec, no rename detection) via `git log`.**
///    `git log --no-renames -- closed_paths` enumerates every commit
///    that touches any closed path. git's pathspec engine prunes whole
///    subtrees and skips rename detection entirely.
/// 2. **Per-commit rename detection in-process via gix.** For each
///    touched commit, [`walker::name_status`] is called against the
///    commit's *walk-order* parent — the same baseline Pass 2 uses, so
///    the rename rows Pass 1 surfaces are exactly the rows Pass 2's
///    [`walker::advance_with_entries`] will encounter. (On merge
///    commits the walk-order predecessor is whichever parent the gix
///    rev-walk emitted next; that may differ from `commit^1`, but it's
///    the only baseline whose entries Pass 2 actually consumes.) New
///    rename/copy pairs that intersect the trail grow `closed_paths`;
///    the loop iterates to fixed point.
/// 3. **Phase B for `AnyFileInCommit`.** Copies whose source was *not*
///    modified in the commit can't be detected from the cheap pass at
///    all; a single full-range `-C -C` `git log` scan completes the
///    trail. Skipped for `Off` and `SameCommit` (where the source is
///    always among the pass-1 touched commits).
///
/// `AnyFileInRepo` widens copy sources to any blob reachable from any
/// ref — outside the per-range scope a single `git log` invocation can
/// express. Falling back to "every commit interesting" preserves the
/// walker's whole-ref widening (`widen_copies_any_ref`) in Pass 2.
///
/// Returns `(closed_paths, interesting_commits, fell_back)`. On
/// `fell_back == true`, `interesting_commits` is empty and the caller
/// must treat every commit as interesting.
