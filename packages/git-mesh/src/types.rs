//! Data shapes for git-mesh.
//!
//! All types describe the v1 on-disk shape (see `docs/git-mesh.md` §4).
//! Every field is required; defaults are applied at creation time so
//! stored records fully self-describe their resolver behaviour.
//!
//! ## Error type
//!
//! This crate uses `thiserror` to define a library-level `Error` enum as
//! the public boundary for fallible operations. A CLI crate could reach
//! for `anyhow::Error` for brevity, but an enum-based error makes it
//! possible for downstream consumers (including the crate's own tests
//! and future library consumers) to match on variants without string
//! matching, which is the idiomatic Rust public-API choice.
