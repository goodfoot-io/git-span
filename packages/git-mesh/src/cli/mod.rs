//! CLI top-level — parses args and dispatches to library functions.
//!
//! Design choices:
//!
//! * **`anyhow::Result<i32>` at the CLI boundary.** CLI handlers return
//!   `anyhow::Result<i32>` so exit codes are first-class (§10.4
//!   distinguishes `0`, `1`, `2` for `git mesh stale`). Library errors
//!   (`crate::Error`) convert via `?`; `anyhow` keeps the dispatch
//!   layer from having to enumerate variants.
//!
//! * **`git mesh <name>` vs `git mesh <subcommand>`.** Clap cannot
//!   disambiguate a positional-name from a subcommand without help.
//!   We handle this in [`crate::main`] by checking the first argument
//!   against [`crate::validation::RESERVED_MESH_NAMES`] (the spec's
//!   reserved list, §10.2) before parsing. A reserved token is treated
//!   as a subcommand; anything else is a mesh name passed to the
//!   `Show` handler.
