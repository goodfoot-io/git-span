# Wiki Page Authoring

## Workflow shape

End-to-end loop for creating or updating a wiki page:

1. Write or edit the page (frontmatter with `title` + `summary`, fragment links to source).
2. Run `wiki check --fix <page>` to auto-pin fragment-link SHAs and create covering spans for line-ranged fragment links.
3. Consolidate the created spans into meaningful per-source-file (or per-subsystem) spans rather than the per-link split it creates by default. Write meaningful `why` text — not `[why]`.
4. `git span add` requires every anchored path to exist in HEAD. If the wiki page is one of the anchors (it usually is), the page must be committed before `git span add`. The wiki page itself does **not** need to be committed for `wiki check` wikilink resolution — `repo_inventory` unions tracked paths with untracked-Added items.
5. Commit each new span with `git add .span && git commit`.
6. Run `wiki check <page>` — should exit clean.

## `wiki check` failure modes

In the order they typically surface:

- **`missing_sha`** — fragment link has no pinned `&<sha>`. Fix: `wiki check --fix` auto-pins from git history. Never hand-edit SHAs.
- **`broken_wikilink`** — no page has the given title or alias. Likely causes: frontmatter `title`/`aliases` does not match the link text (resolution is case-insensitive but exact otherwise), the target page lives outside the discovered wiki roots, or the target path is gitignored. HEAD presence is **not** required — `repo_inventory` includes untracked files. If a fresh `wiki list` shows the page but `wiki check` does not, suspect a stale `wiki/.index.db` or a binary-version mismatch.
- **`span_uncovered`** — every fragment link with a line range (`#L<start>-L<end>`) must be covered by a `git span`. Whole-file links do not require coverage. Fix: `wiki check --fix` creates covering spans; consolidate and commit them.

## Disk hygiene

`wiki/` accumulates runtime artifacts that must not be committed: `.index.db`, `.index.db-wal`, `wiki.log`. Add a `wiki/.gitignore` excluding them when first setting up. `wiki.toml` may be empty.

## Span anchoring requirement

`git span add` rejects anchors whose paths do not exist in HEAD. This applies to the wiki page itself when it is one of the anchors — commit the page before staging spans that reference it. (This is a `git span` constraint, not a `wiki check` constraint.)
