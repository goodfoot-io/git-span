# Implicit Semantic Dependencies

An *implicit semantic dependency* is a load-bearing relationship between two
files that the type system, test suite, and build graph do not enforce. When
file A and file B must change together to remain correct, but nothing in the
code mechanically links them, the contract lives in someone's head — and
breaks silently when that person is not in the room.

This skill mines git history to surface those pairs. It combines 13 signals
(co-change, lagged co-change, defect propagation, churn correlation,
cross-language symbol overlap, branch topology, reviewer overlap, and more)
into a unified ranked shortlist. The pairs at the top are the strongest
mesh candidates: real coupling that is currently invisible.

## When to Use

Trigger this skill when the user asks any of:

- "What files secretly depend on each other in this repo?"
- "Find implicit / hidden / latent dependencies"
- "What are the mesh candidates here?"
- "Which files change together but don't import each other?"
- "Show me logical coupling / co-change analysis"
- "Find load-bearing relationships not enforced by types"

Also trigger proactively when planning a large refactor or onboarding to a
new codebase — the shortlist is a map of where the contracts live.

## Scripts

Three scripts live in `scripts/`. Run them in order: `mine.mjs` produces a
JSON corpus, `shortlist.mjs` distills it into actionable pairs, `explain.mjs`
drills into a single pair to verify the signal.

### `mine.mjs` — produce the JSON corpus

The engine. Runs all 13 signals, writes `potential-implicit-semantic-dependencies.json`
alongside itself, and prints a long human-readable report to stdout.

```bash
node scripts/mine.mjs --since=6.months --top=25 --no-gh
```

Key options:

- `--since=<git-date>` — history window (default `1.year`). Use `3.months`
  or `6.months` for active repos; `1.year` for stable ones.
- `--max-commit-files=<n>` — drop commits touching more than `n` files
  (default 40). Mega-commits dilute every signal.
- `--min-support=<n>` / `--min-confidence=<f>` — co-change thresholds.
- `--top=<n>` or `--top-percent=<p>` — section size cap.
- `--skip=12,13` — skip slow techniques (SZZ, reviewer overlap).
- `--no-gh` — skip reviewer overlap even if `gh` is on PATH.
- `--fix-regex=<pattern>` — override the bug-fix detector. The default catches
  English fix vocabulary; supply a pattern matching the project's commit
  conventions if §2 (fix-only co-change) is empty.

`mine.mjs` streams git log incrementally, so it handles large histories
without buffering the full log. Narrow the window with `--since` or add path
excludes via `--exclude=path1,path2` when a run is slow. The default excludes
already cover lockfiles, build outputs, snapshots, and minified bundles.

### `shortlist.mjs` — distill JSON to mesh-candidate ranking

Reads the JSON written by `mine.mjs` and prints only §0 — pairs that fired
across multiple techniques — with each technique's specific evidence
attached.

```bash
node scripts/shortlist.mjs                       # default JSON path
node scripts/shortlist.mjs --min-techniques=3    # only highly-supported pairs
node scripts/shortlist.mjs path/to/mine.json --top=10
```

Each shortlisted pair shows which techniques fired, their numeric values, and
a copy-pasteable `explain.mjs` invocation. The shortlist is the actionable
output; the long `mine.mjs` text report is mainly useful for forensics.

### `explain.mjs` — verify a single pair

Lists every commit in the window that touched both files, with subject, sha,
date, and author. Use after shortlist to confirm a pair's coupling is real
and to read the human reasoning across past co-changes.

```bash
node scripts/explain.mjs <fileA> <fileB>
node scripts/explain.mjs <fileA> <fileB> --since=2.years
```

A pair with high mining-signal but commits that are unrelated (different
authors fixing different things in the same sweep) is a false positive.
A pair with commits that consistently cite the same concern is a real
mesh candidate.

## End-to-End Workflow

Identify implicit semantic dependencies in three passes:

**1. Mine.** From the repo root:

```bash
node .claude/skills/implicit-semantic-dependencies/scripts/mine.mjs \
  --since=6.months --top=25 --no-gh
```

This writes `potential-implicit-semantic-dependencies.json` next to the
script and prints a 13-section report. Skim §0 of the report; the JSON is
for the next step.

**2. Shortlist.** Distill to actionable candidates:

```bash
node .claude/skills/implicit-semantic-dependencies/scripts/shortlist.mjs \
  --min-techniques=2
```

Pairs firing in 3+ techniques are very likely real coupling. Pairs firing in
exactly 2 techniques deserve a look — verify with explain.

**3. Explain.** For each candidate worth pursuing:

```bash
node .claude/skills/implicit-semantic-dependencies/scripts/explain.mjs \
  packages/foo/src/Foo.ts packages/bar/src/Bar.ts
```

Read the commit subjects. Ask:

- Does one file rely on a contract the other defines but does not enforce?
- If the related anchor changed silently, what concrete wrong decision would I make?
- Are these the same bug recurring under different names? (SZZ signal)

If yes, the pair is a real mesh candidate. Document the contract — a comment
referencing the related anchor, a type that captures the shared shape, a test that
fails when one side changes without the other, or an explicit `mesh` entry
if the project uses one.

## Reading the Output

The aggregate shortlist tags each pair with the techniques that fired:

```
[1,4,7,11,12]
  packages/foo/src/Producer.ts
  packages/bar/src/Consumer.ts
  techniques (5): 1=co-change, 4=range, 7=lagged, 11=churn, 12=SZZ
    co-change: support=8.2 conf=0.91 jaccard=0.33
    range:     emitMessage ↔ handleMessage support=4.1
    lagged:    Producer.ts → Consumer.ts support=6.8
    churn:     r=0.78 weeks=18
    SZZ:       Producer.ts → Consumer.ts ×3
```

The reading: every time `Producer.ts` changes, `Consumer.ts` follows within
a few commits (lagged); both files breathe in sync week-to-week (churn);
their churn is concentrated in the `emitMessage`/`handleMessage` pair
(range); and historical bugs in `Producer.ts` have been fixed by also
touching `Consumer.ts` (SZZ). Five orthogonal signals agree — this is a
real producer/consumer contract worth making explicit.

A pair with `[1]` only is a single-signal hit and is much more likely noise.
Filter with `--min-techniques=2` (default) or `--min-techniques=3` for higher
confidence at the cost of recall.

## Heuristics for Acting on Results

**Trust the multi-technique pairs.** A pair that fires in 3+ orthogonal
techniques is overwhelmingly real. Investigate before dismissing.

**Distrust pairs with high `authors∩` jaccard.** If the same person writes
both sides, the contract lives in their head and changes consistently —
mining will flag the coupling but it is not "hidden", just personal context.
The hidden-coupling rerank in §1 already pushes these down.

**`[structural]` tags mean explicit coupling.** One file references the other
by name (import, manifest entry, doc link). The coupling is real but already
known to the compiler/reader; less urgent than truly latent pairs.

**Empty §2 and §12 means the regex misses your conventions.** Use
`--fix-regex='your|fix|vocabulary'` to align the bug-fix detector with
project commit style.

**Range pairs (§3) tell you *where*.** A function in A coupled to a section
in B is more actionable than the file-level pair, because you know exactly
where the contract lives. Pull range pairs out of `range_pairs` in the JSON
when planning a fix.

## Additional Resources

- **`scripts/mine.mjs`** — the 13-technique mining engine. Self-contained;
  no dependencies beyond Node and git.
- **`scripts/shortlist.mjs`** — JSON consumer; prints the actionable §0.
- **`scripts/explain.mjs`** — per-pair commit listing.
- **`references/techniques.md`** — deep dive on each of the 13 signals:
  what they measure, when they are trustworthy, how to tune them, and how to
  read each section of the long report. Consult when output looks empty or
  when deciding whether to trust a particular signal.

## Common Failure Modes

- **`mine.mjs` reports 0 fix commits**: default fix regex misses the
  project's vocabulary. Set `--fix-regex=` to the team's actual style.
- **Shortlist is empty**: lower `--min-techniques`, widen `--since`, or
  drop `--min-support`/`--min-confidence` in `mine.mjs`.
- **Shortlist top is dominated by manifest/doc pairs**: those are already
  tagged `[structural]` in §1 of `mine.mjs`'s text report. The shortlist
  inherits them through §0; treat structural pairs as known coupling and
  filter them out by reading the per-pair evidence.
- **`gh` errors**: pass `--no-gh` to skip technique 13. The other 12 still
  run.
- **Run takes too long**: pass `--skip=12,13` to drop SZZ (per-fix `git
  blame` calls) and reviewer overlap (network).
